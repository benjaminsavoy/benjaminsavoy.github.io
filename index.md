## Welcome

Hello! I'm Benjamin Savoy. I'm a Software Engineer by day and I cultivate a few interests in my free time, but mainly photography.

Until I feel the need to go and develop a fully-featured personal website, if you would like to follow what I am doing, please have a look at the following pages:

Do feel free to contact me through any of the above social networks if you need to reach out to me.
